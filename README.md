# Twenty Forty Great

Ever felt like you aren't judged enough as is? Do you want the crippling feeling of your every move being watched to extend into your free-time activities? Look no further, as twentyfortygreat uses state-of-the-art AI to judge your playthrough of 2048.

Taking inspiration from the great 2048 game, the wonderful auto-players made by numerous people, but in our case, specifically @ronzil, and chess.com's merciless analysis of your chess games and ability, we culminate this all into your favorite waste of time, 2048.

Enjoy countless features such as
- unnecessary overhead
- an annoying and condescending clippy-like character that judges your moves
- and an uncalled-for recap and analysis of your (probably failed) 2048 game.

And to stay afloat in this economy, we plan to add
- GPT-4 integration
- various pay-to-win features such as "unlock undo moves"
through an novel and innovative subscription (& advertisement) based revenue plan

We will be expecting an initial seed round as soon as I can convince one of my business major friends to stop playing golf every weekend.
